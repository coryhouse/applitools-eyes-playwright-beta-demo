## Playwright Benefits

- Free
- Built in
- Simple. Files are stored next to test files.

## Eyes Benefits

- Annotations
- Accessibility checks
- Dashboard allows approving one diff at a time via a thumbs up. (With Playwright, you update all snapshots at once via `npx playwright test --update-snapshots`)
- Scale. Don't have to store images in repo. Image processing occurs in the cloud.
- More configurable? Examples here.
