## Playwright Snapshot Benefits

Playwright is pixel-to-pixel based, which leads to many false positives, especially since new browsers and devices are released every few weeks. Flake encourages developers to increase the threshold, which leads to false negatives.

- Free
- Built in
- Get a lot of coverage quickly and easily
- Easy to get started. No API keys, accounts, or code refactoring required.
- Runs locally. No network calls.
- Simple. Files are stored next to test files.
- Generally faster than Eyes. (Eyes uploads images to the cloud, processes them with more powerful algorithms, and returns the results back to the client).

## Playwright Snapshot Drawbacks

- Pixel-to-pixel based. Leads to false positives, especially since new browsers and devices are released every few weeks. Flake encourages developers to increase the threshold, which leads to false negatives.
- No annotations. Can't highlight or comment on diffs.
- No accessibility checks.
- No dynamic content support. Can't mix `layout` and `strict` modes.

## Eyes Benefits

- Annotations
- Accessibility checks
- Supports A/B testing.
- Support dynamic content. Mix `layout` and `strict` modes instead of arbitrary, time-consuming, numeric thresholds.
- Can capture regions with scrollbars.
- Don't need browsers installed locally.
- More reliable. Less flake. [Playwright flakes when not run on the same hardware/OS/machine](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/13873) and [here](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/29117). With Eyes, the test runs in the cloud on the same hardware/OS. On average more than 10% of the tests that pass with Applitools fail when
  using a pixel to pixel engine with a 5% threshold (the default setting for most
  open source libraries). For an average company that runs 300,000 checkpoints per month, this translates to around 360,000 false positives per year that needs to be
  manually reviewed by a developer.
- Dashboard allows approving one diff at a time via a thumbs up. (With Playwright, you update all snapshots at once via `npx playwright test --update-snapshots`). this is only useful when you know the baseline should be updated and that all tests should be updated. This isnâ€™t useful when you find an unexpected change. If you want to update one snapshot at a time, you have to manually delete the snapshot file and run the test again, or change the name of the checkpoint image to exactly match the name of the existing baseline image.
- Failed CI tests are easier to handle. With Playwright, a failed Snapshot on CI requires downloading the report, hosting the report, and opening the report's URL. And once open, no actions can be taken from the report, so you have to hunt through the filesystem, and update the proper image, then commit to trigger a new CI build. With Eyes, you click thumbs up to approve the test directly from the CI report.
- Diff images are always available, even for passed tests. With Playwright, only failed tests generate diff images. (Reviewing passed test images can help catch bugs, especially when the test is flaky).
- If there's an image merge conflict, it's a pain. You can't see the image diff in Git. Have to resolve locally and push. And if you want the image in main instead of your branch, you need to switch to main, copy the image, then switch to your branch and paste it in the right spot. With Eyes, you can approve the diff directly from the CI report.
- No need to configure CI to store images. Eyes stores images in the cloud.
- Scale. Don't have to store images in repo. Image processing occurs in the cloud. And with the new [Applitools Ultrafast Grid](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/ultrafast-grid/overview.html), you can run tests in parallel across multiple browsers and viewports. With Playwright, you execute your entire test suite on every browser/environment. This can be slow and expensive compared to the Ultrafast Grid.
- More configurable? Examples here.
- Dedicated support with SDK that is frequently updated.

- "We had a few customers that tried using Playwright builtin Visual Testing capabilities and recently switched to Applitools since they found that as they scaled the volume of tests, the cost of handling all the false positives, and maintenance of test results (following browser version updates, UI changes, etc.) was too much to manage, so they decided that it makes more sense to invest in Applitools and save time/cost for their engineers." - Moshe Milman, Applitools
